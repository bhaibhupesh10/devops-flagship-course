    Thank you so much for your kind words and blessings! It truly means a lot, especially coming from someone who played such an instrumental role in shaping my journey. I still remember being in my 2nd year of college during the lockdown, participating in the ARTH program. While I may not be working with the same tools and technologies today, what you really instilled in me was a deep desire to learn and stay curious - a trait that has been invaluable in my path to becoming a software engineer.

    I'm deeply grateful for your guidance, and I hope you continue to inspire both my juniors and the rest of us. Thank you once again for everything, sir.`
